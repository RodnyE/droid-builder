This is my amazing [ds-builder project](%gh_url%)!

## Setup
Install the dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Development
Run nodemon file watcher server:
```sh
npm run watch
```

## Build
To create the DroidScript project,
use the following command in your favorite android terminal (preferably Termux)
```sh
npm run build
```

It will be created in `/sdcard/DroidScript` folder to later be compiled to apk with the 
[DroidScript app](https://droidscript.org)
